Lunatech assigment
==================


Requirements
------------

* Postgresql 9.5.4
* Postgis 2.2.2
* sbt


Installation
------------

### Setup database user, db and postgis extension

as postgres user (`sudo su - postgres`):
```sh
cat << EOF | psql -U postgres -d postgres
  DROP DATABASE lunatech;
  DROP USER lunatech;
  CREATE USER lunatech WITH
    INHERIT
    LOGIN
    NOSUPERUSER
    NOCREATEDB
    NOCREATEROLE
    ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'assignment';
  CREATE DATABASE lunatech WITH
    OWNER = "lunatech";
  ALTER ROLE lunatech SET search_path TO lunatech,public;
EOF

cat << EOF | psql -U postgres -d lunatech
  CREATE EXTENSION "postgis";
  CREATE EXTENSION "pg_trgm"; -- for fuzzy search
EOF
```

### Create the tables and populate the database

Run sbt in the project's directory, with instructions to execute the database migration.

```sh
sbt "; project flyway; flywayMigrate"
```

The database is now ready for use.


Running
-------

Run sbt in the project's directory starting up the play web server:

```sh
sbt run
```

A webserver is started listening on port 9000


Usage
-----

Once the application is setup and running, point a web browser to `http://localhost:9000`

The application is composed of three pages:

* `http://localhost:9000`: index page, with just a table showing how many entries each table has.
* `http://localhost:9000/reports`: reports page, with four tables showing the reports.
* `http://localhost:9000/query`: query page, with country search box, two tables, a map and a log panel.

### Index page

If the database is setup correctly it should display the following information:

* Countries: 247 entries
* Airports: 46505 entries
* Runways: 39536 entries

### Reports page

There are four tables, two on the upper half of the window, two on the lower half:

* Upper half
  * Countries having most airports
  * Countries having less airports
* Lower half
  * Most common used runway surface identifiers per country
  * Most common runway indentifiers


#### Countries having most airports

The table shows a country per row, with all the country information (id, code,
name, continent, wikipedia link, keywords) and the number of airports belonging
to it.  By default the table is ordered from the country having most airports
to the one having less airports.  The table displays only the first ten
entries, as per specification.


#### Countries having less airports

Like the previous tables, but showing the last ten entries.  It is a bit
problematic as there are more than ten countries having just one airport (24 to
be precise), so the information is not complete.

#### Most common used runway surfaces identifiers per country

It shows the number of different surfaces (with count) split by country.
So, for example, the "TURF" surface (case sensitive) is seen:
* 7175 times in the United States
* 306 times in Canada
* 3 times in Australia
* 2 times in Puerto Rico
* 1 time in Germany
* 1 time in United Kingdom

Again, full country information is shown, along with the surface name and how many runways use that identifier in that country.
By default the table is ordered by
* the number of runways sharing the same identifier in that particular country,
* if the number is the same, using the alphabetical order of the surface identifier
* lastly, the country code

#### Most common runway identifiers

It simply shows the number of runways using a particular 'leIdent' identifier.
The table contains the 10 most popular occurrences, ordered by popularity.


### Query page

The most interactive page.

You'll notice that the bavigation bar has been augmented with a search box and
a submit button, and a misterious light blue and gray area on the right side.
The search box should be glowing blue. An indication that it is the starting point of the interaction.

Other elements in the pages are:

* a map, on the upper-right side, centered on Europe (if you zoom in, you'll notice that Netherland is in the center);
* a black-ish area on the bommo-left side, showing two entries, one in green, the other in blue. It shows some logs;
* two empty tables labeled "Airports" and "Runways" in the upper-left and bottom-right corners respectively.

#### Search country

As you click on the "Search countryâ€¦" box, a drop-down menu appears, with a list of countries.
As you start typing, the list shrinks showing only the countries matching the string the search box.
Note: it will use the name, the code and the keywords of each country to find a match.

As the user hits enter, the first country matching the criteria is selected and
three requests are sent to the server, as shown in the logs box (here using Netherland as example):
```
-> GET /api/country/NL
<- GET /api/country/NL
```
The client asks for full information about the country, then requests the corresponding list of airports and runways:
```
-> GET /api/airports/NL/geojson
-> GET /api/runways/NL
<- GET /api/airports/NL/geojson
<- GET /api/airports/NL
```

It then populates the map and the two tables with airports and runways.

#### The Airports table

Once populated, the Airports table displays in the title which country the airports belong to, in this example it shows:

`Airports in Netherlands [NL/EU]`

It also display one airport per row, with the following columns:

* ID
* Ident
* Name
* Type
* Region
* Municipality

The user can scroll down to look for more entries, or use the search box in the
upper right corner of the table to filter the results.

#### The Runways table

Like the Airports table, it displays in the title which country the runways belong to.

The information shown by this table is:
* Airport (its Ident)
* ID
* Idents
* Surface
* Length (in feet)
* Width (in feet)
* Open (green/check is yes, red/cross is no)
* Lighted (green/check is yes, red/cross is no)
* Headings (in degrees)
* Elevations (in feet)

Clicking on a row will select that airport, instructing the Runways table to
show runways belonging to that airport (by applying the airport Ident in the
search box). The map will also have that airport selected and centered, and a
popup will show more information about the airport.
